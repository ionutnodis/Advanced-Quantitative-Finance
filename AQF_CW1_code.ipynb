    "#### b) You want the price of the Lookback option to be suciently precise. Specifically, you want the width of the 95% confidence band 10 to be £0.01, i.e. if the confidence band is [c1; c2] then c2−c1 = 0.01. How many simulations N do you need to achieve this when doing standard Monte Carlo simulation? How many simulations N do you need to achieve this when doing Monte Carlo simulation using Antithetic Variables"
